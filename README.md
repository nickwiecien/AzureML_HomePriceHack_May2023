# Azure Machine Learning - Home Price Prediction Hack

## Azure Machine Learning Background

[Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) is Microsoft’s enterprise-grade machine learning development platform which pulls together all the necessary services and resources to support data science initiatives of any scale while leveraging [MLOps best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/mlops-machine-learning). 

AML has been designed to meet the needs of data scientists of all skill levels – whether your preference is to develop using graphical UI tools or to build and deploy models directly in code. Using AML you can prepare data, build reusable development environments, train models, track experiments, deploy to production, and monitor performance all from a single pane of glass. This hack is designed to give you hands-on experience working inside AML to achieve all the tasks listed above.

## Hack Overview

Machine learning is all around us and increasingly touches our lives in ways we may not even realize. For anybody in the home-buying or apartment-rental market you may have used tools like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, or Apartments.com in your hunt. These tools provide detailed overviews of properties along with quantitative descriptions of the unit, neighborhood, recent buying trends, etc. Most properties also come with an estimated purchase/rental price similar to the Redfin estimate shown below. 

These estimates are generated by ML models (that have been trained massive datasets) which aim to predict what the ultimate purchase price will be based on information about the property and others nearby.

In your hack you will be building a similar model using a classic ML dataset – Boston Home Prices. Briefly, the [Boston Home Prices dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area database in 1970 and contains records of properties in suburbs or towns of Boston. 

Each record contains the following information in the table below. Using machine learning, a model can be trained to predict the median value of the home (`MEDV`) using the other input features.

| Feature                                | Description                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ZN`                 | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. |
| `INDUS`            | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town |
| `CHAS` | Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) |
| `NOX`     | Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)  |
| `RM`    | Average number of rooms per dwelling |
| `AGE`    | Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 |
| `DIS`     | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres |
| `RAD`     | Index of accessibility to radial highways |
| `TAX`     | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 |
| `PTRATIO`     | Pupil-teacher ratio by town |
| `LSTAT`     | % Lower status of the population |
| `CRIM`     | Per capita crime rate by town |
| `MEDV`     | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's |

## Hack Activities

For your hack, you will work through all the steps needed to train a model, deploy to production, and set up automated retraining. We’ve broken these activities into 7 separate tasks which can be viewed in the numbered 'Challenges' folders. Each folder contains a README with detailed instructions and task completion requirements. Many of these tasks build upon each other so it is strongly recommended you complete them in order. 

Each README contains links to the documentation needed to complete the challenge activities - if you get stuck spend some time spend some time looking through these docs! This is an untimed, open-ended event which is focused on learning above all else! Don’t hesitate to reach out to us or your peers for help if you get stuck and above all else have fun!
